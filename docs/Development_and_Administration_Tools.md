# Development and Administration Tools

## Notifications

To configure the email notification read the [documentation for email notification](https://webscripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Server_Configuration/#server-configuration) ([wiki](https://github.com/mauricelambert/WebScripts/wiki/Server-Configuration#server-configuration)).

For temp configuration or tests i recommend to use [command line arguments](https://webscripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usages/#smtp) ([wiki](https://github.com/mauricelambert/WebScripts/wiki/Usages#smtp)).

## Debug the Content Security Policy

To debug the CSP you may use the `--security` arguments (you should not change the `security` configuration for security reason) and configure the email notification. You have a `application/json` page on `http(s)://<server>:<port>/csp/debug/` with the *Content Security Policy Report*

```bash
WebScripts --security --admin-adresses "admin@email.com" --n-adr "notification@email.com" --s-server "smtp.email.com"
```

## Tests

### Unittest

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test -p Test*.py -v
```

| File          | Statements | missing | coverage |

| Errors.py     | 27         | 0       | 100%     |
| TOTAL         | 2151       | 5       | 99.76%   |


### Hardening

1. To *harden* the WebScripts installation run this command with privileges: `sudo WebScripts/bin/python3 -m WebScripts.harden -p '<my admin password>' -o '<my webscripts user>' -d 'WebScripts/'`. See examples on [installation page](https://webscripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/) and [deployment page](https://webscripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Deployment/).
2. The *hardening audit* is performed when WebScripts server starts. The audit report is written in `audit.html`, `audit.json` and `audit.txt` and emailed to Administrators.
HTML report examples:

| CRITICAL      | Operating system compromission (RCE, privileges escalation...)                                                    |
| HIGH          | WebScripts Server compromisssion and bypass of critical hardening rules                                           |
| MEDIUM        | Denial of service of WebScripts server and administrator access (violation of data confidentiality and integrity) |
| LOW           | Good practice to avoid an unexplained crash of the service                                                        |
| INFORMATION   | Risky features you need to secure (you should not activate these features if it is not necessary)                             |

### File integrity

The *WebScripts file integrity* is checked hourly since version *2.5.0* (location, size, modification/creation date and content), since version *3.0.0* modules, cgi scripts and logs are checked too.

 - [+] Scripts are checked
 - [+] Static files are checked
 - [+] Javascript files are checked
 - [+] Data files are checked
 - [+] Uploads files are checked
 - [+] Logs files are checked
 - [+] Configuration files are checked

### Test configurations and interface

To test the interface and configurations, I added a python script, invisible in the web index page, but you can use it to try, test or discover new features. The script is called `test_config.py`, you can get it from this URL (on `localhost:8000`) [http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/scripts/test_config.py](http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/scripts/test_config.py).
